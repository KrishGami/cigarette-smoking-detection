# Cigarette Smoking Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning–based system to automatically detect cigarette smoking behavior from images. The model classifies an input image into two categories: cigarette_smoking and not_smoking. The system is designed for applications such as surveillance in no-smoking zones, public safety monitoring, and automated compliance systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains images of people who are smoking and not smoking.

Dataset Link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vitaminc/cigarette-smoker-detection

Dataset Details:
The dataset consists of two classes:
1. cigarette_smoking  
2. not_smoking  

The dataset is not included in this repository due to size and licensing constraints. Please download it directly from Kaggle using the link above and place it in the appropriate directory structure before training.

## Methodology

A transfer learning approach is used with MobileNetV2 as the base model. The pre-trained ImageNet weights help extract meaningful visual features, while fine-tuning on the smoking dataset improves task-specific accuracy. The model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
